IDE bug:
- https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/3801

Multiple incompatible crates:
- stm32f3xx_hal via (stm32f3-discovery)[https://crates.io/crates/stm32f3-discovery] VS stm32f30x_hal via (f3)[https://crates.io/crates/f3]
- One providing ok support for **LEDs**, the other one for **Buttons** ?
- I went for f3 crate (stm32f30x_hal) because there was less abstractions so it's easier to understand and user underlying APIs. Also more examples are available, and references to 30x_hal in svdrust crate.

Interrupt
- No reference to interrupt in f3 crate
- reference to interrupt in stm32f3-discovery doesn't mention the macro
- from [cortex-m-rt](https://docs.rs/cortex-m-rt-macros/0.1.8/cortex_m_rt_macros/attr.interrupt.html) the note is difficult to understand, it's written the "device" crate is for me to replace by correct crate generated by svd2rust, but finding such crate is difficult, it's probably not a "*_hal" because these are written by hand ? So in my case it must be [stm32f30x](https://docs.rs/stm32f30x/0.8.0/stm32f30x/).
  - the documentation for [svdrust](https://docs.rs/svd2rust/0.14.0/svd2rust/#peripheral-api) has examples for my crate 
ðŸ˜ƒ, but when `interrupt` is mentionned, the examples are a bit lacking (initialization there, then follow links to understand 2 different concepts... to reapply to svd2rust then to your specific device...).

User button:
- I am reading user button via `unsafe { (*stm32f30x::GPIOE::ptr()).idr.read().bits() & 1 != 0 }`, why is it `GPIOE` and not `GPIOA` ? User button is connected to **PA0** pin...
